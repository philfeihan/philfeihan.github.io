    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I've never been a one-trick pony. I built a decade-long career in design, leading products from concept to launch. But I wanted to do more than design—I wanted to build, to understand the logic behind the interface, and to speak the language of technology fluently.</p>
    <p>So I pivoted again, back to school. I'm now a Data Science student at Dalhousie University, merging a designer's mind with a developer's skillset (front-end, Python and more). My goal is to create digital products that are not only intuitive and beautiful but also deeply intelligent and data-informed.</p>
    <p>I'm inherently curious and see technology as a universal passport to new worlds.</p>
    <p>Oh, and I think and create in user flows, code, and visual design.</p>
